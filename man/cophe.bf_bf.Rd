\arguments{
\item{bf2}{named vector of BF, or matrix of BF with colnames (cols=snps, rows=signals)}

\item{causal.snpid}{Id of the query variant}

\item{pn}{prior probability that the causal SNP  is associated with trait 1}

\item{pc}{prior probability the causal SNP of trait 1 is associated with both traits}

\item{p1}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 1, default 1e-4}

\item{p2}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 2, default 1e-4}

\item{p12}{prior probability a SNP is associated with both traits, default 1e-5}
