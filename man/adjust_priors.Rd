\usage{
adjust_priors(nsnps, p1 = 1e-04, p2 = 1e-04, p12 = 1e-05, pa = NULL, pc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsnps}{number of SNPs}

\item{p1}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 1, default 1e-4 (coloc prior)}

\item{p2}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 2, default 1e-4 (coloc prior)}

\item{p12}{prior probability a SNP is associated with both traits, default 1e-5 (coloc prior)}

\item{pa}{prior probability that a non-query variant is causally associated with the query trait , default \eqn{pa = p2} (cophescan prior)}

\item{pc}{prior probability that the query variant is causally associated with the query trait, default \eqn{pc =  p12/p1+p12} (cophescan prior)}
}
\value{
vector of pn, pa and pc adjusted prior probabilities
}
