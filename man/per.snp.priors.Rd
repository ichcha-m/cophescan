\arguments{
\item{nsnps}{number of SNPs}

\item{p1}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 1, default 1e-4 (coloc prior)}

\item{p2}{prior probability a SNP is associated with trait 2, default 1e-4 (coloc prior)}

\item{p12}{prior probability a SNP is associated with both traits, default 1e-5 (coloc prior)}

\item{pa}{prior probability that a non-query variant is causally associated with the query trait , default \eqn{pa = p2} (cophescan prior)}

\item{pc}{prior probability that the query variant is causally associated with the query trait, default \eqn{pc =  p12/p1+p12} (cophescan prior)}

\item{pn}{prior probability that none of the SNPs/variants in the region are associated with the query trait , default \eqn{pn = 1 - (pa*(nsnps-1)) - pc} (cophescan prior)}
}
\value{
priors at the query variant
